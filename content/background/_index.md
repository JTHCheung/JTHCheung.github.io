#• Analysed the association between cigarette smoking and the overall survival of multiple myeloma (a type of getriatric cancer) patients, resulting in a manuscript titled “<i>Pre-diagnostic Cigarette Smoking and Overall Survival in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients</i>”. <br>
#    • Conducted an exploratory spatial analysis of county-level multiple myeloma incidence rates across the U.S. to generate etiologic hypotheses, resulting in a manuscript titled “<i>Geospatial Analysis of Population-based Multiple Myeloma (MM) Incidence in the United States</i>”. <br>
#    • Collaborated with a colleague to analyse the association between overall survival in multiple myeloma patients, 5hmC signatures in cell-free DNA, and chromosomal abnormalities, resulting in two conference abstracts “<i>Population-specific 5-hydroxymethylcytosine Signatures in Circulating Cell-free DNA and Overall Survival Among Blacks and Whites with Multiple Myeloma</i>” and “<i>Population Differences in the Associations Between Chromosomal Abnormalities and Overall Survival Among Blacks and Whites with Multiple Myeloma</i>”. <br>
#    • Designed a follow-up survey using validated instruments to assess quality of life, depression, anxiety, social support, financial burden, intention to seek complementary and alternative medicine, spirituality, and religiosity in a cohort of multiple myeloma patients. <br>
